# exPENsion
## Idea
One player starts with a scribble, another makes a drawing out of it.
Further explanation of this idea can be found here: https://playcuriously.wordpress.com/scribble-art/ (though I didn't learn about the idea from there)
Name is a combination of "pen" and "extension"/"expansion" (players draw with virtual **pens** and one player **expands** on the other player's scribble).
